#    sqlauth.conf
#
#    first up the sqlauthrouter with an example authentication / authorization environment
#
#    the roles file must have postgres, mysql or sqlite set.  Do not set more than one
#    for this example, I don't know what would happen!
#
#    this example is tuned for postgres, so PGDATA needs to be in the environment and
#    the path variable needs to have the postgres executables accessible (/usr/local/pgsql/bin).

#
# this says that the web server will be on 192.168.200.87, default WSPORT 8000. So, after running
# this command I would have my browser load:
#
# http://192.168.200.87:8000/index.html
#
# needs to have externally defined (environment variable):
#   WANIP    if you want to use the example web page to access the sqlrouter, then
#            the WANIP that it connect to is needed.  This can be 127.0.0.1 only if
#            the web browser is on the same machine as the sqlrouter/sqlbridge.  Normally,
#            you would set this to the private IP address for your test machine, like
#            192.168.1.54 (e.g.)
#   IP       127.0.0.1 is the default, you can set it to something else if you
#            really want to.  It is concievable that it might be the same as the WANIP,
#            for example.
#   WEBPORT  8000 is the default. If you are going to access the demo web page this
#            is the WSPORT that your browser needs to connect to
#   WSPORT   8080 is the default.  Run the web socket stuff on WSPORT 8080 (or whatever else you
#            might want).
#   TOPIC    com.db is the default.  It is possible to have different topic
#            roots, but, this is just a demo :-)
#   PGDATA   points to the postgres data directory
